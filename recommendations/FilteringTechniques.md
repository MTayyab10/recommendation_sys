You can absolutely keep both approaches in your project—this gives you a strong basis for comparing classical memory‐based collaborative filtering with a model-based (matrix factorization) approach in your thesis. Here’s how you can think about the workflow and next steps:

### **Two Parallel Paths: Memory-Based vs. Matrix Factorization**

1. **Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering:**
   - **Workflow:**  
     - **Data Loading:** Your `load_data.py` command loads reviews and meta data into your database.
     - **Recommendation Generation:** Functions such as `create_interaction_matrix()`, `calculate_similarity()`, and `recommend_for_user()` (in `memory_based.py`) take the review data and compute user–item interaction matrices, compute cosine similarity between users, and generate recommendations based on weighted ratings.
   - **No Explicit Training:**  
     - This approach doesn't require an offline training phase. Instead, it computes recommendations in real-time (or semi-real-time) using the current interaction data.
   - **Use for Baseline Comparison:**  
     - It provides a baseline for your thesis—its performance (e.g., RMSE, precision@K) can be compared with the matrix factorization model.

2. **Matrix Factorization Approach:**
   - **Workflow:**  
     - **Data Loading:** Same as above.
     - **Model Training:** A separate management command (e.g., `train_mf.py`) trains an SVD (or another matrix factorization model) using the Surprise library on your review data.
     - **Model Saving & Prediction:** The trained model is saved as `svd_model.pkl`, then loaded in your recommendation API to quickly predict ratings for user–item pairs.
   - **Advantages:**  
     - Better scalability for very large datasets.
     - Ability to uncover latent factors that capture hidden user preferences and item attributes.
   - **Evaluation:**  
     - You can compare its RMSE and ranking metrics with the memory-based approach.

### **Next Steps**

1. **Implement and Test Both Approaches:**
   - **Memory-Based Functions:**  
     - Ensure your `memory_based.py` functions (memory-based) are well-tested by generating recommendations for sample users.
   - **Matrix Factorization Model:**  
     - Train the SVD model using `train_mf.py`, evaluate it using RMSE and other metrics, and verify predictions through your API.

2. **Develop a Unified API (Optional):**
   - Create an API endpoint that lets you choose which recommendation method to use (e.g., via a query parameter: `?method=mf` or `?method=memory`). This allows side-by-side comparisons.

3. **Evaluation and Comparison:**
   - **Metrics:**  
     - Evaluate both approaches using RMSE, Precision@K, Recall, and diversity metrics.
   - **Experiments:**  
     - Conduct experiments by varying parameters (e.g., number of latent factors for SVD, different similarity measures for memory-based CF).
   - **Analysis:**  
     - Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each method, discuss the scalability trade-offs, and provide insights for potential hybrid models.

4. **Document in Thesis:**
   - Describe the methodology of each approach.
   - Present experimental results and compare performance.
   - Discuss how combining both methods could lead to a hybrid model that leverages the strengths of each (e.g., using memory-based CF for new users and MF for established users).

### **Summary**

- **Data Loading:** Both approaches use the same loaded review and meta data.
- **Memory-Based CF:** Uses functions to build an interaction matrix and compute cosine similarity in real-time.
- **Matrix Factorization:** Requires an offline training step (using SVD) and then makes predictions quickly via a saved model.
- **Next Steps:** Implement, test, evaluate, and compare both methods; optionally combine them in a unified API; and document your experimental findings for your thesis.

This dual approach not only enriches your research but also provides robust evidence of innovation by comparing classical and modern techniques. Let me know if you'd like specific code examples or further guidance on any part of this process!
