Below is a detailed thesis outline tailored to your Intelligent E-commerce Recommendation System project. This outline is structured into chapters with suggested topic headings and content for each section. You can use this as a blueprint for drafting your thesis. Although you already have a literature review, remember that the thesis must include all key parts—from abstract to conclusions—so you’ll integrate your literature review as Chapter 2.

## Thesis Writing Strategy

- **Start Early:**  
  Begin drafting chapters (especially Introduction, Methodology, and Literature Review) while you are still finalizing your experiments. You can iteratively update the Results and Discussion chapters as your project evolves.
  
- **Iterative Updates:**  
  Use your experimental logs and evaluation results to update your thesis continuously. This approach helps capture insights and improvements throughout the project lifecycle.
  
- **Integration with Project:**  
  Since your thesis and project are intertwined, make sure to document every step (data loading, model training, evaluation metrics, optimizations) in your thesis methodology. This documentation not only strengthens your thesis but also ensures that your research is reproducible.
